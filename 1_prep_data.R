# Natural growth rate
# UN population division 
# Crude birth rate minus the crude death rate. Represents the portion of population growth (or decline) determined exclusively by births and deaths.

# Life expectancy at birth
# The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area.

# Children Born per Woman
# Fertility rate
# Total fertility rate represents the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility rates of the specified year.
